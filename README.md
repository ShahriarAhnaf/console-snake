# console-snake
using only a console application to make a functional snake game

implements new things : enum, switch statements, console input output directly
finishedv1 : added score counter, trying to make array logic to better emulate the follow function of a snake.

v2: FIXED ARRAY LOGIC to perfectly follow snake segments and not cause map extension due to longer snake, working on collision logic with its own body!
objOrient1 : created header and cpp files, object oriented programming. proper encapsulation
